## Xenia Foxx / Critter
###### it/its | agender | ΘΔ

Hello! My name is Xenia, though I also go by Clover, and am online under xenisnotadog, cloverisnotadog, creaturemoding, crittercultist, and finally, just Critter.

I'm a therian furry who does stuff and things!

What I do is usually in the realm of music, and occasionally visual arts such as; collage, painting, wood carving, lino printing, making stickers, taking photos, and sometimes editing them. I enjoy a large amount of media of all kinds; movies, tv shows, anime, cartoons, graphic novels and comics, art exhibits, books. As long as it interests me, I will probably conusme it. I'll link to a post about this [here](https://critter.dog/about) where I'll list off my interests in greater detail.

I also exist on several social medias, however my twitter is strictly 18+ as I do occasionally engage in mature subject matter. My bluesky isn't quite as active, but you can find me there as well, and it is safe for all audiences! Aside from this, I am active on several other platforms, however it is best to reach out to me through one of the two I just mentioned first if you'd like that information!

This site is going to be used as a blog, as well as a wonderful little place to just dump thoughts and projects. Hopefully I'll be able to consistently work on my album reviews and post them here. I'll also be posting updates about the music I'm currently creating, the bands that I'm in or that stand out to me, and other art that I feel like sharing!

Thanks for reading, and if any of what I do interests you, bookmark me :) and maybe follow me on twitter for the shorter form intermediate updates :P

Enjoy your stay,

-Xenia Clover Foxx
