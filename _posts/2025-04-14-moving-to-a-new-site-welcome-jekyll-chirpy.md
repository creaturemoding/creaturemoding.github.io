# A Fresh Start For critter.dog

## Why?

When I first started this site, it wasn't meant to be updated frequently, nor was it meant to look all that nice at all. The original site was made in something called "Bootstrap Studio", which is - to be quite honest - a royal pain in the ass. It was janky to work with, never really had any decent themes to work with, and for what I was using it for, it just wasn't worth the effort anymore.

## So What Now?

Well, this! This site is now being run with the static site generator [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll). It's what github pages usually runs, but I've decided to take that even further, and I'm running the theme [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page). Is it way overkill for me? Haha yeah probably still a bit overkill for what I want to do, but I am not gonna let that stop me from hopefully making good use of this. After all I have gone through all the effort to set it up, it would be a shame not to.

## Any Big Plans?

As of right now? Yes actually! I've been meaning to do an "album a day" kind of thing, and the whole reason I went through all this effort was to set up a much easier way of posting that kind of review and information and stuff. I would love for this to become an ongoing thing that I do, but knowing my ADHD, that might not happen.

Another thing that I'd like to use this site for, is honestly just the random bullshit that I get up to sometimes. I play and write music, take photos sometimes, and sort of like the idea of journaling. Hopefully this can become the official best way to see longer form content from me!

## Anything Else I Should Know?

Not really! That's about all I have to add to this first post here, I'll be adding to the [about](https://critter.dog/about/) page very soon if you aren't already familiar with me!
