# Welcome to AoTD

Hello wonderful blog! Today I want to start by introducing something that I plan on continuing as long as possible. Album of The Day! The basic idea is as follows; I select an album, I listen and take notes, what I like about the songs, how they sound, how I'd rate them, etc. And at the end, I tally up their scores, and talk about the album in a short summary. They'll all be given a percentage, rounded to the nearest 10th. I think this will give albums a good representation of score. Of course this is all subjective and based on my own opinions, so don't take anything too personal if I give your favourite album ever a lower score. 

# Picking Albums

There are several ways that I'll pick an album, the main ones being;

* An album from my CD collection
* An album that I want to show off
* Albums that are recommended to me
* Albums that are new/coming out
* Albums that I find at thrift stores that look interesting

The way albums are picked vary, but I will probably work through them one at a time, starting with my CDs, moving on to the ones I want to show off, and then on to stuff that is recommended to me or things that I find at thrift stores. The albums that are new/coming out, will probably be thrown in as they come out.

# Why?

Honestly, I just need something to do. I have a ton of time on my hands until school starts in the fall, and I love music and listening to it. Will I be able to do it every single day? Realistically, probably not. There's a good chance I will be able to listen to an album and take notes every day, but I may end up having trouble writing blog posts for every single day. If I ever do end up with a backlog, I'll try to get them all out when I can.

# Qualifications

I have none. This is just cause I want to and I'm gonna have fun doing it. Don't take me seriously.

# When?

Now! Well, hopefully. I'm halfway through the first album that I wanted to go through, and I'm still taking notes and stuff. I'll probably end up writing it up later tonight when I have the chance! 

That's all for now, signing off,
