Wanted to start doing this again as seriously as I can so here's number two! This one comes from a band Panchiko that my friend introduced to me a few years back! While like most people I was drawn to the band by their mysterious backstory (which you can read about elsewhere if you are interested), and their first album D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L , I have come to enjoy Failed at Math(s) quite a bit, and in some cases more than the album that brought them to fame. FaM(s) is a neat blend of atmosphere and guitars that will never leave you hungry for more. Some of the tracks are instrumental, while some bring on that juicy lyricism we've seen from them before. Let's take a look at the tracks!

# [Failed at Math(s) - 84%](https://album.link/i/1672465654)
## Track 1 - Failed at Math(s) - 8/10
The titular track, and one that didn't grab me until a few listens in, though when it did grab me, it got me good. It's a catchy song with a groovy bassline, haunting vocals, and those Panchiko synths accompanying it all. The percussion is sparkling and soft, and not tiring on the ears at all. The melody does get a bit repetitive, but I think it suits the song perfectly fine. Overall a good introduction to the album and quite pleasant!
## Track 2 - Portraits - 5/10
I know. 5 is bad. But I honestly just do not get this song! It's slow and I don't particularly care for the chorus. The instrumentals are ok, I think the synths are doing a little too much in some cases and not enough in others. The breathy vocals don't sit as well in the mix as they do on other songs, and I would have honestly just left this one off the album.
## Track 3 - Until I Know - 9/10
This is the track that got me hooked on the album, strong punchy guitar with a chilled out verse that gives the chorus room to breathe. The lyrics are well written and they are sung even better! The track brings their talent for atmosphere and their alt rock riffs right together in a blend of mystery and tension. I would listen to this track on repeat and wouldn't complain, it's just as catchy as some of the other favs on this album, and serves as a perfect hook if the first two didn't get you onboard.
## Track 4 - Breakfast Séance - 10/10
Kicking our instrumental tracks off with one of my favorites, Breakfast Séance delivers the juiciest bass off any of the albums tracks. Some light vocals but no lyrics that serve you a delicious slice of sauce, for lack of a better descriptor. The instruments all play into each other here, and everything feels like it's in the right place. I prefer this of the two instrumentals, but just you wait because we have more to talk about with that second one later!
## Track 5 - Find it (A Song) - 7/10
Again not my favorite, but this one still seems more enjoyable to me than Portraits. It almost feels like a twenty one pilots song in ways I don't like, but it definitely still has those Panchiko vibes. Honestly, don't really want to talk about this one more, it's not that interesting to me.
## Track 6 - Gwen Everest - 9/10
BANGER!! This track is high energy and lots of fun, you can find yourself singing along very easily. I'd easily put this one up there with Until I Know, though I think I would give this one a .5 extra if that was in the cards, as the lyrics are a lot better on this track in my opinion. It's got some great guitar on it and some accompanying synths that I think sound really good in context. They use pauses very well, and the track really comes and brings the album together. This one is probably a top track for most people I would assume.
## Track 7 - Think That's Too Wise - 9/10
Agh! Another 9/10! Back to back! This one is so short, but man it hits, it feels like a Panchiko classic, the vocals are on POINT and the lyrics are very much them. They bring back out that kind of funny mic thing that they do in D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L, which I really like. Big fan of the electronic instrumentation on this one, regardless of how well it meshes, the sounds scratch my brain right.
## Track 8 - Rocking with Keith - 10/10
Another 10/10 for an instrumental too! It's a great song, this one I really just have to appreciate the piano on, the drums almost sound slightly overdriven and there's such a harsh background compared to this soothing piano melody we're presented with. It's nearly 6 minutes of pure enjoyment. The percussion is exciting enough that I'd point it out directly, because it really does have a depth to it that I quite enjoy on this track. You can be bopping your head along to this, or quite likely sobbing as well. Very nice track!


# Final Thoughts
Failed at Math(s) is an album I am going to be listening to for a long time. It's going to stay in the rotation! It's one of those albums that sure, I'm not always in the mood for, but I'll come back to it time and time again, it's such an interesting development off their last album and it explores new direction while keeping their signature sound that fans enjoy. And for being released  a good 23 years after their first album, it's quite amazing that they clung on and made a good album that still very much reflects their sound. I don't have very much to say about the album aside from what I've already gotten into, but you definitely should listen to this one, and even D>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L if you have the chance!
