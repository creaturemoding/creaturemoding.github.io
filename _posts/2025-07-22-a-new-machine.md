# Let's Get Started (Again)

Let's be real, It's about time I started posting again. I haven't been active with posting album of the days or even anything super consistent here. But it's about to all change, because I've got a trick up my sleeve. But first, let me explain some backstory!

I've got horrendous unmedicated ADHD, alongside a bunch of other ridiculous issues that sure as hell don't help with how often I can make myself do things. Including things I love! Like writing for this silly little blog! But that's also in combination with the fact that until now, I've only had my PC to work with! My PC is great but for being the only machine I could make posts on, it just wasn't working out... I'm not at home as much as I used to be, which meant I just never had a good chance to take 10, 15 minutes out of my day to write about a ~40-50 minute album! But here's the trick;

I got myself a fancy new M4 Macbook Pro for school :)

Not only does this mean I have a machine capable of all my note taking, audio software learning, and 3d modelling, but I also have the ability to write blog posts from *wherever* now! I'm taking this site PORTABLE and now my music taste will surely become everyone elses problem :P

Anyways, it's not a super exciting blog update in terms of things to talk about, but know that there are more posts coming up, even if I can't fully stick to my album of the day reviews! Until then, I'm signing off!
